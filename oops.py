# class is blueprint of objects, Objects have attributes(name, age, color) and behavior(dancing, singing)
# Why need to use OOPS -  Structuring programs so that properties and behavior bundled in Objects
# Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.



# ---------------------------- ABSTRACTION --------------------------------

# Hiding the details is called data abstraction
# Abstract class is a class in which one or more abstract methods are defined.
# When a method is declared inside the class without its implementation is known as abstract method.
# Concrete Method : Method in abstract class which already have the implementation

# ---------------------------- POLYMORPHISM -----------------------------------

# Polymorphism is a foundational concept in programming that allows entities like functions, methods or operators
# to behave differently based on the type of data they are handling.
# 1 - Compile time Polymorphism : Method overloading
#  2 - Runtime Polymorphism : Method Overriding - Runtime decide on basis of type of data method get to perform task

# -------------------------- ENCAPSULATION ---------------------------------------

# Encapsulation is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through an objectâ€™s methods
# Python achieves encapsulation through public, protected and private attributes.

# PROTECTED MEMBERS : Protected members are identified with a single underscore (_).
# They are meant to be accessed only within the class or its subclasses.

# Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from one parent class.
